## 1. Get gas price
Query Ethereum's GasPrice forecast data, Interface data updates per 8s, please don't access frequently, or you will be blocked. A high-availability cluster has been deployed.

### Request
- International: GET https://www.gasnow.org/api/v3/gas/price?utm_source=:YourAPPName

### Parameters
- utm_source String. Your app name (e.g. xCompany)

### Response Example
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "data": {
    "rapid": 180132000000,
    "fast": 177000000000,
    "slow": 150000000000,
    "standard": 109000001459,
    "timestamp": 1598434638872
  }
}
```

## 2. RPC Node
Choose the rpc node with the lowest delay, broadcast transactions more efficiently.

**Asia-Pacific: https://api.taichi.network:10001**

**Europe: https://api-eu.taichi.network:10001**

**North: America https://api-us.taichi.network:10001**

## 3. Send Private TX | eth_sendPrivateTransaction
Submit a signed transaction to the node, and it will not be broadcasted to the Ethereum network before the transaction is sealed in a block.

### Caveats
1. We provide private transaction with our best effort. However, there are still ocassions that your private transaction can be exposed to public before 
confirmation. Such cases include but are not limited to
    * The block containing private tx becomes uncle block.
    * The block chain reorgnizes and block containing private tx becomes orphaned block.
    * Deficiency in Ethereum specs or implementations.
2. Private transactions still conform to gas price requirement. If the gas price is too low, it will wait for a long time or even lost.
3. We currently only provide a portion of hash power for private transaction, so not all blocks mined will contain private transaction.
4. Rate limit: 50/sec.

### Parameters
DATA, signed transaction data.
```json
params: ["0xf86c0785080ad9f00082627094302fc4c7231589239912d62ec7ea6266d771cfdf88024a8d93446ac0008025a01450674b2c65e7902d9f03cbf899bb1063b2b14ca5e6a7fa5616d420b67196c1a049063bc399b171b0c570aeba9d33bc78a550701c3e95238947b90f1ccf841032"]

## 6. Broadcast TX | eth_sendUncheckedTransaction
Same as `eth_sendRawTransaction`, but never checks nonce or gas price of the transaction. This can be used to broadcast transactions with faster response. You have to make sure yourself the transaction is valid.

## 7. MEV Bundle | eth_sendBundle
You can pack multiple transactions into a bundle. If you pay enough ETH to coinbase through the bundle, it will be placed at the font seat. 

For reference, check [docs at Flashbots](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint).

### Request
```
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_sendBundle",
  "params": [
    {
      txs,               // Array[String], A list of signed transactions to execute in an atomic bundle
      blockNumber,       // String, a hex encoded block number for which this bundle is valid on
      minTimestamp,      // (Optional) Number, the minimum timestamp for which this bundle is valid, in seconds since the unix epoch
      maxTimestamp,      // (Optional) Number, the maximum timestamp for which this bundle is valid, in seconds since the unix epoch
      revertingTxHashes, // (Optional) Array[String], A list of tx hashes that are allowed to revert 
    }
  ]
}
```
### Response
```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": null}
```
### Example
```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_sendBundle","params":[{see above}],"id":1}' https://api.taichi.network:10001/rpc/public
